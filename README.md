# SPRK

This is just a wrapper around the axios to make a multipart/form-data request to a tool I wrote. You can find the tool [here](https://github.com/Sparkenstein/sprk). 

### Usage
 - install the tool with `npm install -g sprk-bin`
 - set these two ENV variables with your favourite method:
   - SPRK_SERVER_URL=http://example.com/
   - SPRK_API_KEY=sampleAPIKey
 - Then you are good to upload any file from any folder to your private instance of `sprk`

-----

PS: just a reminder, the `SPRK_API_KEY` here and on your `sprk` instance should match.
